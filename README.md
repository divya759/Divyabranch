I am Divya B H currently working as Bigdata Developer in Business Solution International from Jan 2020.
I am trying to create a prpogram to build a Satellite Channel (DTH) Subscription System like TataSky.
The user should be able to subscribe to a Package with Annual plan. 
The user should also be able to subscribe to an add-on pack for a monthly subscription to a sports channel.
The interface including Channel, Package, Plan and Subscription.
Here I have considered Traits, Classes.
I am using cats library. The Main object defines two sample subscriptions, subscribes them to the InMemorySubscriptionService, and retrieves them to ensure they were stored correctly. 
This example does not include any HTTP or API functionality, as code is focused solely on the storage and retrieval of subscription data.
